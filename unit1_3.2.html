        <p>
            To improve my productivity, I took regular breaks to drink water, have a quick snack, and rest my eyes from the computer screen. Getting up every hour to stretch my limbs or participate in a yoga class stopped my body from getting stiff, enabling me to work longer than if I just sat in front of my computer for hours at a time. Watching the pledger talks over Zoom was amazing motivation to crack on with the project, research more HTML and CSS codes to become a better dev. By generally looking after your body with exercise and eating well will keep your mind clear to focus on the task.

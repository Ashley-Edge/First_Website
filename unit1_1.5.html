        <h3>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>

        <p>
            It is essential to select the right IT systems and software carefully. When choosing the right technology, I would need to think about;
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Functionally</li>
                <li>Compatibility</li>
                <li>Skills and support required</li>
                <li>Ability to scale up</li>
                <li>Security [4]</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I would also research what my potential competitors are using and why. I could gain an advantage on them by having a better set up or it could save me time in deciding what to use. I would also take into account on what the team is most familiar with and build upon their experiences.

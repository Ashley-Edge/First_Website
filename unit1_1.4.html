        <h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h3>

        <p>
            Risk is a reality and mustn’t be underestimated. A good digital project plan will factor in that known and unknown risks can and will happen. You should ask yourself;
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>“What could go wrong during this project?”</li>
                <li>“Are there actions we can take now to prevent the chances for running into identified risks?”</li>
                <li>“What is PLAN B for each risk we have identified?”</li>
            </ul>    
        <p>
            Problems could range from a competitor developing a new and exciting feature on their website. Halfway through your project, Apple might release a new version of iOS and what you have worked on so far doesn’t work properly on the new version. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having these thoughts will prepare you for when/if a problem occurs with an already thought plan on how to fix it. [3] Building in extra time into your plan will help with risks that you couldn’t predict or plan for.

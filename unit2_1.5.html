        <h3>1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

        <p>
            Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual property. It allows the copyright owner to protect against others copying or reproducing their work. [8]
        </p>
        <p>
            Including images on your website is an easy way to make your website more appealing and engaging. Obtain royalty-free images from reputable sources. It is also a good idea to do a background search on the image before using it, just to make sure. One sure-fire way to protect yourself against copyright laws is to take your own images/create your own artwork. [9]
        </p>
        <p>
            You must always properly cite any copyrighted material you have used. The information should be clear enough, so the reader can be easily directed to the original source. (I have been doing this throughout this assignment!)

        <h3>1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h3>

        <p>
            JPG – Is one of the most common image format used. JPG’s are highly compatible with a small file size with quality loss. The downside of using JPG’s is that they don’t support transparent backgrounds and it’s difficult to layer them with other elements. [12] JPG is best used for full colour photos.
        </p>
        <p>
            PNG – Another common and versatile image format used. It boasts a “lossless” compression, meaning you won’t lose and picture quality when saving. PNG is the best format for screenshots and most computers will automatically use PNG. This format is best used for graphical elements. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
            GIF – Its unique feature is its ability to be animated. Popular used to clip iconic moments form popular culture to invoke a “MOOD”. GIF’s weakness is that the quality of the pictures can be lost. So, its best use on websites are icons and graphics with few colours. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
            TIF – Is known as the highest quality image format. Its best used for commercial print work and not for the web. Keeping a TIF copy of your original photographs is a good idea, as it offers lossless compression. However, it should be exported to a JPG or PNG for use on a website. [12]

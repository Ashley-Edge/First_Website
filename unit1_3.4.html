            To check that my website works and is easily read and navigable it should be tested. I regularly ran through the website myself to make sure I didn’t get lost or stuck. Adding various navigation bars where they were needed to make sure that didn’t happen. Sharing my website folder on Slack and GitHub could bring up errors that I wouldn’t necessarily spot. I would get available friends and family members to navigate through it and work on any feedback presented.

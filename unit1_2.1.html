        <h3>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
            </h3>

        <p>
            The more I have been using Visual Studio Code (VSC) to build this website, the more short-cuts I have picked up and used, which have saved me a lot of time. Firstly, using commands like ‘copy’ ‘cut’ and ‘paste’ helped me save time by not having to re-type up my code every time I re-use it. Then, remembering the keyboard shorts-cuts and making a conscious effort to use them have. This continuous effort has saved me a lot of time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy anything [command + c]</li>
            <li>Cut anything [command + x]</li>
            <li>Paste [command +v]</li>
            <li>Undo [command + z]</li>
            <li>Redo [shift + command + z]</li>
            <li>Save [command + s]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My use of Trello.com started off slowly, only updating it twice on the first day of this project. Often only after I had finished a task, which was against the whole point of using it. For the second day, I began by entering all the big tasks I knew has to be done for the deadline. Next, I broke down some big tasks even further into smaller tasks, using the checklist tool within my ‘big tasks’ cards. Ticking off work as I went and adding new to do cards/checklist items as I thought of them.

        <h3>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
            your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
            </h3>

        <p>
            The more I have been using Visual Studio Code (VSC) to build this website, the more short-cuts I have picked up and used, which have saved me a lot of time. Firstly, using commands like ‘copy’ ‘cut’ and ‘paste’ helped me save time by not having to re-type up my code every time I re-use it. Then, remembering the keyboard shorts-cuts and making a conscious effort to use them have. This continuous effort has saved me a lot of time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy anything [command + c]</li>
            <li>Cut anything [command + x]</li>
            <li>Paste [command +v]</li>
            <li>Undo [command + z]</li>
            <li>Redo [shift + command + z]</li>
            <li>Save [command + s]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My use of Trello.com started off slowly, only updating it twice on the first day of this project. Often only after I had finished a task, which was against the whole point of using it. For the second day, I began by entering all the big tasks I knew has to be done for the deadline. Next, I broke down some big tasks even further into smaller tasks, using the checklist tool within my ‘big tasks’ cards. Ticking off work as I went and adding new to do cards/checklist items as I thought of them.

        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
            </h3>

        <p>
            I used Visual Studio Code to make my website as it’s the one I’m being taught with. As a beginner code developer, I’ve enjoyed using it and have found the program user friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was required to use Trello.com to plan and manage this project. The Kanban style of planning and organising was great at keeping myself on track. It was also used by my instructor to see how I was getting on as I have been learning at home away from code nation’s classrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I have been learning to code from my own home, I have found Zoom to be an amazing tool to communicate with my instructor and fellow classmates like I would in a physical classroom setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slack was used to send course materials, share our coding progress with our instructor. Slack could have been fully utilised even more if this was a group project.

        <h3>2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
        </h3>

        <p>
            I am very happy with how my website turned out within the limited time frame and the training I have had so far. If I could change anything, I would have added my own photographs and artwork, I simply didn’t have time to photograph and design my own, so I have relied on royalty/copyright-free images. I would have also liked to include more coding “tricks” to show off my abilities more.

        <h3>2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project
            </h3>

        <p>
            I would like to have taken the time to go out and about around Manchester to take a great photograph to use as my website's main background image. Similarly, I would have liked the time to create my own icon and button artwork in Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator. If I had more time, I could have research coding tips and tricks to make my website look more professional with a more impressive layout than I have managed to achieve in three days. I would have loved to add a small text-based page to my homepage as well, those are really fun.

        <h3>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>

        <p>
            Planning out the website and adding my content to Trello.com was effective. I made sure each webpage used the same style and similar layout to keep my website consistent. By clearly labelling the HTML, CSS, and PNG files together in one folder made storing and retrieving files effectively clear and easy.

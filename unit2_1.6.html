        <p>
            Web accessibility lets people with cognitive difficulties, vision impairment, or those who are deaf or hard of hearing gain access to online content such as webpages, electronic documents, and multimedia. [10]
        </p>
        <p>
            People with visual impairments can make use of a screen reader in order to hear what is written on a website. These software applications provide a computer-synthesized speech output of what appears on the screen. [11]
        </p>
        <p>
            From personal experience (I am dyslexic) and can find it hard to read huge blocks of text. Using text reading software can help, but in public settings, it can be inconvenient. Simply breaking up text, adding images or charts can make a website easier to take in and digest.
        </p>

            For deaf or hard of hearing people, the most obvious solution is subtitles and captions. Making sure these features are synced up correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            For persons with motor impairments (such as limited or no use of fingers or
            hands), the barriers are created by cluttered layout, buttons, and links that
            are too small. These can make sites and their functions unusable for the person if they were to use standard equipment.[11] Alternative keyboards or joysticks are used by people with a range of impairments. [10]

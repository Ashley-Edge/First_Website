    <h3>Outcome 3: Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems</h3>

    <div class="purplebubble">
        <h3>3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
            </h3>

        <p>
            Trello.com was effective at keeping me productive and the project on time. VSC enabled me to create this website. If this project was a group effort, we could’ve used each person’s strengths and ideas to create a beautifully complex website in the specified time frame. A team would have utilised slack and the Trello board more to communicate, delegate tasks, and share code and ideas.

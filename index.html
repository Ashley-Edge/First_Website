            My name is Ashley Edge. I’m from Lancaster, grew up in George South Africa and now I live in Manchester. I live in a fixer-upper terrace house which I bought together with my lovely boyfriend Danny. I love to spend time fixing up and painting the house while this lockdown is ongoing.

            I have a background in fashion, with a BA(Hons) Fashion & Contour degree. For the past 7years, I have worked as a pattern cutter for a fast-fashion brand and loved it. Sadly, my role with the company been made redundant and I have been looking for my next move in life.

            I’ve been wanting to learn how to code and build websites for years, but I never seemed to have the time. I came to Code Nation looking for something to keep my mind occupied during the lockdown and my recent unemployment. This short course could possibly lead me down a new career path as a dev and that idea excites me. I am so glad I took the leap of faith into the unknown (well at least for me it was!) into the world of coding. I am thoroughly enjoying the course; I am able to pour my creative nature into something that demands an eye for detail. If anything, this course has helped me bounce back from my unemployment funk with a new set of skills and a positive outlook for my future. For all, I know my redundancy could be the best thing to happen to my career.

    My name is Ashley Edge and I am from Manchester. I have a background in fashion and up until recently I worked as a pattern cutter for a fast fashion brand and loved it. Sadly, my role with the company been made redundant.

    I came to Code Nation looking for something to keep my mind occupied, and this could possibly lead me down a new career path as a dev! I am so glad I took the leap into the unknown (well at least for me it was!) into the world of coding. If anything, this course has helped me bounce back from my unemployment funk with a new set of skills and positive outlook for my future. For all I know my redundancy could be the best thing to happen to my career.

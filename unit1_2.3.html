        <h3>2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
            </h3>

        <p>
            I am very happy with how my website turned out within the limited time frame and the training I have had so far. If I could change anything, I would have added my own photographs and artwork, I simply didn’t have time to photograph and design my own, so I have relied on royalty/copyright-free images. I would have also liked to include more coding “tricks” to show off my abilities more.

        <h3>3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?</h3>

        <p>
            Next time I would use a team to build a complex and professional website. We would improve productivity through Trello, Slack, and Zoom calls. Plan tasks and delegate “to-do” cards through our team Trello board based on individuals’ strengths. We could help each other through the ‘create a code or text snippet’ on Slack with code we might be struggling with/need a fresh set of eyes to check it. I would make sure each member is drinking enough water, taking enough breaks, and having enough time away from the computer to be able to concentrate and productively work. While working from home having team Zoom calls can boost moral by replacing normal office chit chat and face to face interaction that people would be missing.

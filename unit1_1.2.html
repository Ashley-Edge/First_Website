                You’ll need good communication skills to talk things over with your team to ensure everybody is clear and confident about the task at hand.

                Checking, measuring, and reviewing a project as it progresses against the plan. Adjusting the plan if needed as nothing in life runs as smoothly as you would have expected. This can be a part of team meetings or worked into your solo run project to keep them/yourself on track.

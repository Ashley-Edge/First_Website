            I would like to have taken the time to go out and about around Manchester to take a great photograph to use as my website's main background image. Similarly, I would have liked the time to create my own icon and button artwork in Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator. If I had more time, I could have research coding tips and tricks to make my website look more professional with a more impressive layout than I have managed to achieve in three days. I would have loved to add a small text-based page to my homepage as well, those are really fun.
